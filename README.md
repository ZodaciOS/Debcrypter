# Debcrypter
Command line interface to extract the .deb files via APT

# Introdution

Debcrypter is a CLI tool to extract the .deb files of installed repos via APT. You do not need the package installed to extract the .deb. Ensure you have the repo installed in APT and the bundle ID of the package you want to extract.

# Disclaimer

Debcrypter should not be used for extracting paid tweaks which is pirating. Distribution of pirated paid tweaks is illegal. **This tool is strictly for education purposes only.** 

# Unreliable

Some tweaks may not be able to be complied successfully. If that does happen, try with another tweak. This happens because Debcrypter cannot complie packages that may be paid or listed on a private repo.
